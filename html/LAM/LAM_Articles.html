        <p class="paper-authors">Mohammed Amine Bouanzoul, MD; Yale Rosen, MD</p>
        <p class="paper-journal">Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, 2024, 149(8): 775-788</p>
        <p class="paper-abstract">
          Systenatically summarizes <span class="highlight">the current situation of lymphangioleiomyomatosis study</span>, with its symptoms and therapies.
          Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is characterised by a proliferation of smooth muscle–like cells. These cells carry mutations in one or both tuberous sclerosis (TSC) genes.
          Symptoms of LAM range from exertional dyspnea and coughing to chest pain and recurrent pneumothorax.
          <p></p>
          <h2 class="paper-title">Details</h2>
          <p class="paper-abstract">
          LAM is a rare multisystem disorder belonging to the family of neoplasms exhibiting <span class="highlight">perivascular epithelioid differentiation</span>.The disease is progressive and probably 
          evolves to parenchymal destruction and the formation of cysts.<br>
          LAM can occur at any age, and it has a common factor that <span class="highlight">tuberous sclerosis(TSC) genes mutate</span>. TSC is an <span class="highlight">autosomal dominant </span>inherited disorder.TSC-LAM appears to be
          more common than sporadic-LAM(S-LAM),in which S-LAM exhibits TSC2 gene mutations and TSC-LAM demonstrates that both TSC1 and TSC2 mutate. <span class="highlight">TSC1 encodes hamartin and TSC2
          encodes tuberin</span>.These two proteins form a hetero-oligomer that works as a tumor suppressor complex to control mTOR. If the tuberin and hamartin complex is stimulated by
          growth factors, it will undergo phosphorylation, resulting in a reduction of its GTPase activity. This will activate RHEB, ultimately activating mTOR by binding to raptor
          and other GPCRs.<br>
          Several hypotheses indicated that LAM cells originate from AMLs,lymphatic or bone marrow cells,neural crest cells(NCCs), and even uterine or ovarian cells.
          LAM cells are also capable of spreading to lung allografts in posttransplant patients.<br>
          <span class="highlight">Extrogens </span>can be a risk factor for LAM. It can lead to invasiveness and destruction of lung parenchyma.LAM patients also have increased blood levels of <span class="highlight">prolactin</span>.<br>
          LAM cells can evade the immune system using receptors like programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1).LAM cells also exhibit <span class="highlight">NKG2DL downregulated expression</span>,leading to weak
          recognition by NK cells.<br>
          Recurrences of pneumothorax are frequent and strongly suggestive of LAM.<span class="highlight">Chylothorax </span>is also a common clinical manifestation of LAM,in which the lymphatic fluid leaks into
          the pleural cavity.This may be due to a <span class="highlight">disruption or blockage of the thoracic duct or one of its branches</span>.<br>
          Most radiologic assessments for LAM are performed when patients exhibit progressive dyspnea or recurrent episodes of pneumothorax.<span class="highlight">HRCT of the chest </span>is the preferred imaging 
          modality for evaluating patients with suspected LAM.<br>
          The panel includes VEGF-D testing, testing for a1-antitrypsin deficiency, serum protein electrophoresis and free light-chain quantification for light chain deposition 
          disease,and autoantibody testing for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and Sj  ̈ogren-related antibodies.
          <span class="highlight">A VEGF-D level lower than 800 pg/mL </span>cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis of LAM.Only serum VEGF-D testing has clinical utility in LAM.<br>
          The usefulness of bronchoscopy for diagnosis in patients with LAM remains a topic of debate. Bronchoscopy is generally not needed in cases where clinical suspicion of 
          LAM is high.<br>
          LAM is characterized by <span class="highlight">the presence of cysts </span>of variable sizes and a proliferation of immature smooth muscle–like LAM cells that line the cysts, often in a micronodular 
          pattern.Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and destruction of elastic fibers and collagen are frequent findings.<span class="highlight">HMB45 is the current gold standard</span> immunostain used to confirm 
          the diagnosis of LAM.<span class="highlight">Cathepsin k </span>can also be a marker for LAM cells according to recent studies.The lungs of male and female patients with TSC may exhibit a distinctive 
          lesion called multifocal multinodular pneumocyte hyperplasia(MMNPH).<br>
          <span class="highlight">Sirolimus </span>has demonstrated efficacy in reducing lung function decline, improving quality of life, enhancing functional performance, and reducing VEGF-D levels.
          <span class="highlight">Everolimus </span>has also demonstrated efficacy in treating AMLs, central nervous system tumors, and epilepsy in patients with TSC.These drugs have some side effects such as 
          mouth ulcers, diarrhea, nausea, increased blood cholesterol, skin rashes, swelling of extremities, pneumonitis, ovarian cyst formation, and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.
          <span class="highlight">Lung transplantation </span>has emerged as the optimal approach in patients with severely altered functional status.

          <h2 class="paper-title">Pathology</h2>
          <p class="paper-abstract">
          LAM is a multisystmeic disease characterized by the presense of <span class="highlight">perivascular epithelioid cells</span>, also called LAM cells. The TSC2 protein acts as
          a GTPase, maintaining Rheb in an inactive, guanosine diphosphate-bound form. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt inactivates the TSC complex, promoting the association of mTOR with
          Raptor to form <span class="highlight">the mTORC1 complex</span>. This process will upregulate the downstream proteins p70S6K and 4E-BP1, resulting in increased expression of proteases and <span class="highlight">
          vascular endothelial growth factor</span> (VEGF). Moreover, mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits the transcription factor E (TFE) B and TFE3, further inhibiting autophagy.<br>
          mTORC binds to Rictor, leading to <span class="highlight">the mTORC2 complex</span>, which will activate the Akt and promote LAM cell survival.mTORC2 can also activate RhoA, influencing
          cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell motility.<br>
          In short, while mTORC1 plays as the primary driver of LAM, mTORC2 promotes disease progression through cytoskeletal regulation, migration and survival pathways.<br>
          Hyperactive mTORC1 signaling results in enhancement of metabolism and increased expression of <span class="highlight">angiogenic factors (VEGF-A) [16] and lymphangiogenic growth factors (VEGF-C and VEGF-D)</span>.
          Importantly, in the context of TSC2 deficiency, the transcription factors TFE3 and TFEB move to the nucleus, where they drive the expression of proteases including cathepsin K.<br>
          However, according to recent studies, S6K and 4E-BP1 are regarded as canoncial targets of mTORC1, while TFEB and TFE3 are regarded as noncanonical targets.<br>
          In general, rapamycin inhibits the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1, but increases the phosphorylation of TFEB and TFE3. This results in translocation of TFEB and TFE3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, 
          where they are sequestered by 14-3-3 proteins.mTORC1 is considered a master inhibitory regulator of autophagy via several mechanisms, which include direct phosphorylation and inhibition of the Ulk1/2 kinases
          and direct phosphorylation of the TFEB and TFE3 transcription factors, leading to their exclusion from the nucleus via binding to cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins.

          <h2 class="paper-title">Therapies</h2>
          <p class="paper-abstract">
          The use of <span class="highlight">sirolimus </span>for LAM is approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and drug regulatory agencies in many other regions<br>
          <span class="highlight">Everolimus </span>is approved by the EMA and FDA for the treatment of TSC-associated sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytoma and AMLs;<br>
          <span class="highlight">Chloroquine </span>(CQ): an inhibitor of autophagy, blocks lysosome-autophagosome fusion and lysosomal protein degradation;<br>
          <span class="highlight">Resveratrol </span>seems to counterbalance the increased autophagy induced by rapamycin and, thus, promote apoptosis in TSC-deficient cells;<br>
          RTKs are surface receptors that receive and transfer growth factors. Treatment with <span class="highlight">anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies</span> can reduce the number and size of pulmonary 
          alternations, lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis.<br>
          Binding of VEGF-D to VEGR3 promotes lymphangioogenesis and tumour angiogenesis, improving tumour growth or metastatic spread. <span class="highlight">Axatinib</span> can block the VEGF-D signaling and inhibit 
          the growth of TSC2-null tumours;<br>
          <span class="highlight">Nintedanib </span>is a dose-dependent inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), VEGF and PDGF signalling pathways;<br>
          To downregulate oestrogen, <span class="highlight">triptorelin</span> acts as a synthetic analogue of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone;<br>

          <h2 class="paper-title">Challenges and Future</h2>
