        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>My name is Feiyang Zhang, an undergraduate in Zhejiang University & University of Edinburgh. I major in bioinformatics and enjoy analyzing the complicated genomics data yo find some inspired ideas. In addition, badminton is my favorite sport and I'm open to any communication of skills. Furthermore, playing the piano could be my third hobby if free, which may detach me from the heavy burdens. My favorite video game is Wuthering Wave, which offers me a wonderland to travel and relax.</p>

# Research Interests
- In lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), are there genes or molecular mechanisms capable of compensating for or regulating the loss of TSC1/TSC2 that leads to mTORC1 suppression?
- Beyond TSC genes, are there additional genes that can selectively downregulate mTORC1 activity, functioning in a manner analogous to bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitors?
- Immune checkpoint molecules are overexpressed in LAM and related tumors, enabling immune evasion. Are there genes capable of repressing immune checkpoint expression, or silenced genes that originally provided recognition signals to T cells?
- Can stable, small-scale gene signatures be identified across platforms (microarray and RNA-seq) for LAM classification or subtype stratification?
