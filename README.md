## Research Interests
Since I have learned about a lot of research directions among our school professions, I made up mind 
to tentatively select immunology as my field of interest. Then considering the distance and the background of relevant professors, finally, I chose lymphangioleiomyomatosis, also known as LAM, to have a deep exploration in my future undergraduate years. LAM is a rare progressive disease characterized by TSC1/TSC2 mutations and the hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway. What truly touched me is that this disease happens in pregnant women, and even though it is benign, LAM is largely associated with a poor prognosis. When I was born, my mom and I were sent into the intensive care unit (ICU) because of premature delivery. As we entered the ICU, a mother and her son died probably due to the immature technology. Hence, I always have a thought for rescuing those struggling during birth. This may be the original motivation to direct me to study LAM.
